## _Course Description_
---------------------

This course is an introduction to the major categories of datasets likely to be encountered by environmental data science professionals, as well as common online repositories and access methods including API servers and cloud computing platforms. All coding exercises make use of the Python programming environment.

## _Course Goals_
-----------------------
By the end of the course, students should be able to:

* Locate Environmental Datasets on major cloud computing platforms (Google Earth Engine) and API servers
* Read In Datasets from these platforms onto a local machine
* Perform Quality Control as needed, including infilling or interpolation of missing data
* Subset/Aggregate Data according to the needs of a given application (spatial/temporal averaging, upsampling, etc)
* Visualize Data including through creation of georeferenced maps, time series, and other basic metrics
* Describe Data Pros/Cons: which datasets are most appropriate for a given application, and why?
* Work with Peers to create use case examples for datasets, and communicate to the rest of the class.
